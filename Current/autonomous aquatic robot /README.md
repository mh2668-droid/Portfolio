# Autonomous Aquatic Robot for Invasive Vegetation Management

## Overview
This project is an ongoing research and development effort focused on building a fully autonomous aquatic robot for managing invasive submerged vegetation. The system is being developed as part of the Collective Embodied Intelligence Laboratory at Cornell University.

The robot is designed as a self-contained underwater intervention platform, combining sensing, interaction, and onboard collection to reduce fragmentation and regrowth commonly associated with existing mechanical removal methods.

## Conceptual Design
<img src="robot.png" width="700"/>

The figure above shows an **early-stage conceptual model** used to explore system layout and subsystem integration.  
This model is illustrative only and does **not** represent the final mechanical design.

The platform architecture emphasizes modularity and coordinated underwater operation rather than surface-based harvesting.

## Project Scope
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a cohesive autonomous system capable of:

- Operating in shallow aquatic environments
- Interacting directly with submerged vegetation
- Coordinating cutting, handling, and collection below the waterline
- Retaining biomass onboard to limit downstream dispersal

Design decisions prioritize robustness, controllability, and system-level integration over single-function tooling.

## Current Development Focus
Active work on this project includes:

- Integrating an underwater manipulator end-effector for targeted interaction
- Developing a unified underwater module that coordinates sensing cutting, pumping, and collection

## Research Context
- **Lab:** Collective Embodied Intelligence Laboratory  
- **Department:** Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University  
- **Role:** Robotics R&D (Individual Project)  
- **Advisor:** Prof. Kirstin Hagelskjaer Petersen  
- **Timeline:** Aug 2025 – Present  

## Status
This repository documents an active research prototype.  
Details are intentionally scoped to system-level concepts while implementation evolves toward a working prototype.
