    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a mechanical engineering graduate student focused on robotics, autonomous systems,
      and physical system design. My work spans motion planning, manipulation, and system integration,
      with hands-on experience using ROS, MoveIt, and Gazebo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have led projects ranging from autonomous navigation and robotic manipulation to an
      industry-sponsored capstone in mechanical design and experimental research in biomechanics
      and neuroscience.
