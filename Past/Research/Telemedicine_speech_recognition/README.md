With the continuous development of science and technology and the increasing importance of the elderly to their own health, telemedicine has been favored by more and more people and has gradually become a research hotspot in the medical field. Aiming at the lack of accuracy of telemedicine, this article starts with the basic situation of intelligent speech recognition and explains its application methods and methods; it uses the extraction of Mel frequency cepstrum parameters (MFCC) and dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to pair. The simulation experiment results show that the method can accurately match the corresponding semantics in the reference speech database. This provides a certain reference for improving the application level of the telemedicine system.
